# VM Toolkit Release History

## Version 1.0.0 - Initial Release (Current)

**Release Date**: October 2025

### üéØ Major Features
- **Multi-Architecture Support**: x86_64 (primary), ARM64, i386
- **Apple Silicon Compatibility**: x86_64 emulation and native ARM64 support
- **Performance Options**: ARM64 VMs offer better performance on Apple Silicon
- **Flexible Installation**: Install from any directory with configurable data locations

### üöÄ New Features

- Architecture-specific QEMU binary selection
- Automatic acceleration detection (HVF on macOS, TCG elsewhere)
- Architecture-aware cloud image downloads
- VM registry stores architecture information
- Configurable installation and data directories

### üîß Technical Improvements
- Architecture detection and configuration functions
- Enhanced cloud image support for multiple architectures
- Improved dependency checking per architecture
- Better error handling and validation
- Comprehensive installation documentation

### üì¶ Installation Methods
- Archive-based installation from GitHub releases
- Git clone installation
- Custom installation directories
- Configurable data storage locations

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Support Matrix

| Architecture | Status | Acceleration | Use Case |
|--------------|--------|--------------|----------|
| x86_64/AMD64 | ‚úÖ Full | HVF/TCG | Primary architecture, maximum compatibility |
| ARM64/AArch64 | ‚úÖ Full | HVF (macOS) | Performance option on Apple Silicon |
| i386 | ‚úÖ Basic | TCG | Legacy applications |

### üåç Platform Support
- **Apple Silicon Macs Only**: M1, M2, M3, M4 (tested on M4 MacBook Pro)
- **Architecture Support**: x86_64 emulation, native ARM64 with HVF acceleration
- **Compatible Cloud Images**: Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS for both architectures

### üìã Breaking Changes
- None - fully backward compatible with v1.x VMs

## Upgrade Instructions

### From v1.x to v2.0
```bash
# Backup existing VMs (optional)
cp -r ~/vmq/vms ~/vm-backup

# Download and install v2.0
curl -L https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/vm-toolkit/archive/main.tar.gz | tar -xz
cd vm-toolkit-main
./install.sh --force

# Existing VMs will continue to work as x86_64 VMs
# Create new ARM64 VMs for better performance on Apple Silicon:
vm create --name fast-vm --arch arm64 --os ubuntu
```

### Migration Notes
- Existing VMs remain x86_64 and continue working
- VM registry is automatically updated with architecture info
- New ARM64 VMs can be created alongside existing x86_64 VMs
- Configuration files are preserved during upgrade
